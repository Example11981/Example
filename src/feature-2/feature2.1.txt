Edited the feature 2.1


Feature is create a product;
You are a small mouse;
 After every build, Jenkins sends email notifications and it picks up my incorrect email address from Git commit and tries to send it.

Even after I have changed the email address in my local Git, I still see Jenkins sending the emails to the old incorrect address.

How can I fix this?
